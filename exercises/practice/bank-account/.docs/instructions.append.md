## Mutable data in Prolog

By default, values in Prolog are _immutable_, which means that values never change (you'll have to introduce a new variable for each new value).
While this is great for the vast majority of use cases, this exercise _does_ require mutating values.
To mutate data in Prolog, you can use the [setarg] predicate.
