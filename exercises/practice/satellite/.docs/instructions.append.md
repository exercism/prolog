# Instructions append

You should implement this exercise using a definite clause grammar (DGC).
DCGs can be used not only to parse sequences (lists), but also to generate, complete and check those sequences.

## Library

The stub implementation files includes the following line:

```prolog
:- use_module(library(dcg/basics)).
```

This ensures that the `dcg/basics` library can be used, which should be enough to solve this exercise.
