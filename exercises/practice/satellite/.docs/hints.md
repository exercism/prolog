# Hints

## General

- A tree is a recursive data structure that has two cases:
  - `nil`: a leaf node, which doesn't have a value
  - `node(Left, Value, Right)`: a regular node, which has a value and a left and right node
- For both pre-order and in-order traversal, you'll need to define rules that handle the two cases for trees
