# Introduction

Each spring, the local elementary school holds a ball where all children dress up.
The children arrive in pairs, each consisting of one boy and one girl.

Even though the costumes obscure the children's identities, their parents always try to figure out who wore what costume.
To help the parents a bit, the teacher gave them the following poem:

1. Four pairs stood in the queue,
   Ready for the party to ensue.
2. The girl dressed as a Queen
   Arrived with the boy named Dean.
3. Two pair were already present,
   One boy dressed as a Pheasant.
4. Tarek wasn't the first to arrive,
   But he got there before Clive.
5. The Mermaid (not Tamou) is paired to Nuhk,
   Who was dressed as Donald Duck.
6. Nala joined after Lou,
   Both were there before Tamou.
7. Ann arrived after the Ballerina,
   Neither is paired with Batman.
8. If Snow White arrived after Celeste,
   Then how was each pair dressed?
