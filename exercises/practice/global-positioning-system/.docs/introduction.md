# Introduction

You're a huge fan of [geocaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching), which combines your love for the outdoors with a love for solving puzzles.
Whilst the local geocaching website lists the GPS coordinates of all caches, it does _not_ support creating an efficient route for gathering them.
It so happens you have pathfinding software installed on your machine, but it uses a different GPS format from the geocaching website.
To feed the data into the pathfinding software, you'll need to parse the degrees and hemisphere for both the latitude and longitude of each GPS coordinate on the website.
