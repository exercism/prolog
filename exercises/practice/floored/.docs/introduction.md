# Introduction

Amara, Bj√∂rn, Cora, Dale, and Emiko reside in a five-story building.
Occasionally, the receptionists have trouble recalling the specific floors each person lives on.
However, they should be able to deduce who lives on which floor based on the snippets of information they do remember.
