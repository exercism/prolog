# Introduction

Amara, Björn, Cora, Dale and Emiko live in a building with 5 floors.
The receptionists sometimes forget who lives on which floor.
Luckily, they scribbled some notes a little piece of paper that should help them figure it out:

1. Amara does not live on the top floor
2. Björn does not live on the bottom floor
3. Cora does not live on either the top or the bottom floor
4. Dale lives on a higher floor than Björn
5. Emiko does not live on a floor adjacent to Cora's
6. Cora does not live on a floor adjacent to Björn's
